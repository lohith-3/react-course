# How React Works

SO components are what we write in order to describe a piece of the user interface and the component is just a regular javascript function but it is a function that returns react elements.

Component and Component Instance (has its own props and state)

Note:-

When we call a component directly like this (DifferentContent()), then React no longer sees it as a component instance (<DifferentContent/>).
